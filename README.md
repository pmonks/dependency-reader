# depends
![Project Logo](https://github.com/pmonks/depends/wiki/images/depends.jpg)

Reads dependencies from compiled Java code (.class files) and writes them out in a variety of different formats.

Why might that be useful, I hear you ask?

Welp the personal driver for this project was to support some work I was doing to validate 3rd party extensions to an open source Java product.  Basically I needed to make sure that that 3rd party code didn't use the product's private APIs, didn't attempt threading, didn't use Process.exec() or System.out/err, didn't employ dodgy ClassLoader tricks etc. etc.  I started out using grep but quickly ran into a couple of walls, including: a) not necessarily having access to the source code for these extensions; b) that approach requires manual followup due to Java's rather complex aliasing rules (e.g. is the code "new Thread()" referring to java.lang.Thread or org.sewing.Thread??).

Note: I still consider myself an utter Clojure n00b, so don't look at this code for best (or even mediocre) practices.  Any comments, feedback, criticism is welcome (email address below).

## Installation

Checkout the source from [GitHub](https://github.com/pmonks/depends).

## Running / usage

For now depends is source only, so...

```shell
 lein deps
 # Wait while Maven downloads teh internetz
 lein run -- [switches] source
```
    Switches               Default  Desc
    --------               -------  ----
    -j, --no-json, --json  false    Write JSON to stdout
    -e, --no-edn, --edn    false    Write EDN to stdout
    -n, --neo4j            false    Write to the specified Neo4J server
    -h, --no-help, --help  false    Show help

    Args           Desc
    ----           ----
    source         Returns the dependencies of all class files in the given location (which may be a .class file, a directory or an archive). Must be provided.

Eventually I plan to provide a precompiled executable uberjar as well.

### Examples:
```shell
 # Parse a single .class file and write the dependencies to stdout in EDN format
 lein run -- -e /path/to/myclassfile.class

 # Parse all .class files in the specified directory and write the dependencies to stdout in JSON format
 lein run -- -j /path/to/folder/full/of/crap

 # Parse all .class files in the specified JAR file and write the dependencies to a Neo4J server running on localhost
 lein run -- -n http://localhost:7474/db/data/ /path/to/myjarfile.jar

 # Recursively parse all .class files in the specified EAR file (including those within JARs within WARs within the EAR) and don't write the results anywhere
 # Nonsensical, but possible (I'm too lazy to do proper command line argument validaton *sigh*)
 lein run -- /path/to/myenterpriseturdbucket.ear

 # Recursively parse all .class files in the specified ZIP file (including any embedded JARs, WARs, EARs or ZIPs) and write the results to stdout in both EDN and JSON format, and to a Neo4J server running on another server
 # Why anyone would actually want to do all this in one shot is beyond me...
 lein run -- -e -j -n http://neo4j.veryimportantcompany.com:7474/db/data/ /path/to/yourzipisdown.zip
```
